- 👋 Hi, I’m @io-m
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack software development. On the backend I prefer Golang or TypeScript on Express.js. On the front end I prefer Next.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD flow and tools. I am also solidifying my skills in dockerizing services and ship them via k8s. I am focusing on the code quality and hexagonal architecture.
- 💞️ I’m working on my own app, using Golang on the backend and Flutter + Next.js for mobile app and web app respectively.
